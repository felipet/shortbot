//! Library that includes all the logic related to the management of clients of the bot.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! This library includes modules that are meant to implement all the logic related to the management of users of
//! the bot (clients).
//!
//! Clients' metadata is stored in a data base. However, to speed-up the application a cache subsystem has been
//! developed to keep a coherent copy of the clients' data base in main memory. The application expects no more
//! than hundreds of users, so keeping their metadata in main memory won't demand a lot of resources.
//!
//! How the data is stored is transparent to the bot, which only needs to interface with the module
//! [crate::ClientHandler]. This is the API to access all the logic related to client's management.
//!
//! A minimal setup is required by the startup code. A cache needs to be created at startup and all the handlers
//! need to configured. This process is automated using [crate::ClientObjectsBuilder].
//!
//! ### Example of Use
//!
//! TODO: add an example with the setup of the client management subsystem.
//!
//! ## Organisation
//!
//! The crate includes two main modules:
//!
//! 1. [crate::cache] which is in charge of the cache subsystem.
//! 2. [crate::client] which is in charge of the management logic to keep metadata related to clients.
//!
//! ## What Is a Client of the Bot
//!
//! Users of the bot become _clients_ when they start using some of the advanced features of the bot. This means
//! regular users don't get fully registered in the client DB. All the advanced features relate to those features that
//! need some sort of memory storage.
//!
//! The main purpose of the crate is to free the bot's logic of all the stuff related to remember what tickers is a
//! client subscribed at, or if a client expects to receive some sort of periodical information, and so on.
//!
//! Anyway, all the users that happen to use the bot, at least once, get registered. The main purpose of this feature
//! is enabling later analysis of the bot's usage and how many users are actively using the bot.
//! So any user that uses the bot gets _soft-registered_ or _auto-registered_. Users become _hard-registered_ when
//! they start using advanced features.
//!
//! ## Why This Is a Separated Crate?
//!
//! This crate splits all the logic that relies on the MariaDB backend. The main purpose of this separation
//! is to enable SQLx to properly analyze and build the queries of the application. The bot features
//! several DB backends, which is not supported by SQLx as of today.
//!
//! The most straightforward workaround is to split the code into several crates, each one of them connects to
//! a specific DB backend. This way, SQLx can analyze the code and build the queries properly.
//!
//! All the code related to handling client's preferences, subscriptions or any other information related to them
//! is included in this crate as it relies on the MariaDB backend.
//!
//! # How To Develop This Library
//!
//! In order to build successfully all the code of the application, the following procedure must be followed:
//!
//! For each crate of the workspace:
//!
//! 1. Set up the environment variables for connecting to the DB backend, either via `export DATABASE_URL` or using
//!    `.env` files.
//! 2. Build the crate using `cargo build`.
//! 3. Run `cargo sqlx prepare` to generate the SQLx prepared queries.
//!
//! Remember to commit those files to the repository.
//!
//! After that, the whole workspace can be built using `cargo build`, but we need to run SQLx in offline mode:
//! `export SQLX_OFFLINE=true`.
