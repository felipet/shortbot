üßë‚Äçüíª Do you enjoy using this bot? I do enjoy developing it. It heavily simplifies the way in which short positions can be checked, as CNMV's web page is really annoying.

I'm still full of ideas to foster this bot: position tracking, new short positions watcher, graphs and a long etc. However, this takes a considerable amount of my time.
