pub mod users {
    //! Library that includes all the logic related to the management of clients of the bot.
    //!
    //! # Description
    //!
    //! This library includes modules that are meant to implement all the logic related to the management of users of
    //! the bot (clients).
    //!
    //! Clients' metadata is stored in a data base. However, to speed-up the application a cache subsystem has been
    //! developed to keep a coherent copy of the clients' data base in main memory. The application expects no more
    //! than hundreds of users, so keeping their metadata in main memory won't demand a lot of resources.
    //!
    //! How the data is stored is transparent to the bot, which only needs to interface with the module
    //! [crate::ClientHandler]. This is the API to access all the logic related to client's management.
    //!
    //! A minimal setup is required by the startup code. A cache needs to be created at startup and all the handlers
    //! need to configured. This process is automated using [crate::ClientObjectsBuilder].
    //!
    //! ### Example of Use
    //!
    //! TODO: add an example with the setup of the client management subsystem.
    //!
    //! ## Organisation
    //!
    //! The crate includes two main modules:
    //!
    //! 1. [crate::cache] which is in charge of the cache subsystem.
    //! 2. [crate::client] which is in charge of the management logic to keep metadata related to clients.
    //!
    //! ## What Is a Client of the Bot
    //!
    //! Users of the bot become _clients_ when they start using some of the advanced features of the bot. This means
    //! regular users don't get fully registered in the client DB. All the advanced features relate to those features that
    //! need some sort of memory storage.
    //!
    //! The main purpose of the crate is to free the bot's logic of all the stuff related to remember what tickers is a
    //! client subscribed at, or if a client expects to receive some sort of periodical information, and so on.
    //!
    //! Anyway, all the users that happen to use the bot, at least once, get registered. The main purpose of this feature
    //! is enabling later analysis of the bot's usage and how many users are actively using the bot.
    //! So any user that uses the bot gets _soft-registered_ or _auto-registered_. Users become _hard-registered_ when
    //! they start using advanced features.
    //!
    //! ## Why This Is a Separated Crate?
    //!
    //! This crate splits all the logic that relies on the MariaDB backend. The main purpose of this separation
    //! is to enable SQLx to properly analyze and build the queries of the application. The bot features
    //! several DB backends, which is not supported by SQLx as of today.
    //!
    //! The most straightforward workaround is to split the code into several crates, each one of them connects to
    //! a specific DB backend. This way, SQLx can analyze the code and build the queries properly.
    //!
    //! All the code related to handling client's preferences, subscriptions or any other information related to them
    //! is included in this crate as it relies on the MariaDB backend.
    //!
    //! # How To Develop This Library
    //!
    //! In order to build successfully all the code of the application, the following procedure must be followed:
    //!
    //! For each crate of the workspace:
    //!
    //! 1. Set up the environment variables for connecting to the DB backend, either via `export DATABASE_URL` or using
    //!    `.env` files.
    //! 2. Build the crate using `cargo build`.
    //! 3. Run `cargo sqlx prepare` to generate the SQLx prepared queries.
    //!
    //! Remember to commit those files to the repository.
    //!
    //! After that, the whole workspace can be built using `cargo build`, but we need to run SQLx in offline mode:
    //! `export SQLX_OFFLINE=true`.
